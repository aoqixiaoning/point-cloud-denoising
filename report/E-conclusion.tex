\chapter{Conclusion \& Perspectives}

% TODO:

Some perspectives would be:
\begin{itemize}
    \item a better understanding of the behaviour of the algorithm when we use
        as the functional the area of the boundary, notably, the relation
        between the gradients and the mean curvature
    \item a simulation of the "true" functional in 3D: minimizing the volume of
        the Minkowksi sum $ P + rK $ instead of the one given in  % \ref{TODO}
    \item implement an exact computation in 3D using arrangements and overlays
\end{itemize}
