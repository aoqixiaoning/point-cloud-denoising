\chapter{Introduction}

A 3D scanner is a commonly used device that measures 3D points on the surface of
a physical object.  It produces point clouds that can then be used to create
more complex and complete digitalized models such as meshes. Several methods
exist to build a mesh from a point cloud such that the one described in
\cite{alexa2003computing}. But an important problem may arise when processing
point clouds: since the 3D scanner is a physically-based device, error can be
made during measurements: the resulting point cloud will be noisy. In this work,
we are interested in removing noise from point clouds: we call this technique
\textit{denoising} or \textit{smoothing}.

There is another issue: because we only deal with points, we cannot use all the
techniques developed in image processing like the Fourier transform, wavelets...
A common way to remove the noise from an image is to take its Fourier transform
and filter the high frequencies. In order to apply a filter, we need a notion of
neighbours and thus some kind of parametrization. An image can be easily
parametrized using a grid of pixels. When we have a mesh, we also have a kind of
parametrization but when we only have points, we do not have such
parametrization.

Several methods already exist to remove noise and get smooth point clouds.
They come from different fields: computer vision, computational geometry...

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textit{Gaussian / Laplacian smoothing}: each point is replaced by
        another one computed from the nearest neighbours of the initial point. In
        the Laplacian case, the new point is a convex combination of the
        neighbours (see \cite{vollmer1999improved}).
    \item \textit{Jet fitting} (see \cite{cazals2005estimating}): a jet is a truncated
        Taylor expansion. Such jets are fitted around points. Jet smoothing
        operates by projecting the input points on an estimated smooth
        parametric surface (the so-called jet surface). Jets are good because
        they intrinsically contain differential information such as normal,
        curvature...
    \item \textit{Bilateral smoothing} (see \cite{huang2013edge}): the algorithm
        works by first resampling away from the edges i.e. smooth the point
        cloud around the edges. The second phase of the algorithm consists in
        inserting points by projecting each point onto the implicit surface
        patch fitted over its $ k $ nearest neighbours. This smoothing algorithm
        takes into account the sharp edges present in the point set.
\end{itemize}

During this internship, we will use the following idea: suppose we want to
smooth a surface. To do so, one could move each point in the direction of the
normal to the surface by a quantity related to the mean curvature at that point.
The sign of the mean curvature only depends on the choice of the orientation of
the normal.  The more curved the surface is, the more important the displacement
will be. For an initial surface $ S_0 $ an $ t \geq 0 $, let $ S_t = X_t(S_0) $
where $ X_t : S_0 \to \R^3 $. The evolution of the surface thus produced can be
modelled with the following partial differential equation:

$$ \partiald{X_t(x)}{t} = \meanv{S_t}(x) $$
where $ \meanv{S_t}(x) $ is the mean curvature vector of $ S_t $ at $ x $
(see Definition \ref{prop:curvatures-surface} for a more complete definition).
A family of surfaces $ S_t $ that satisfies the above equation is said to evolve
by mean curvature flow (MCF).

This partial differential equation can be seen as the geometric equivalent of
the heat equation where the Laplacian is replaced by the mean curvature
vector. Both of the Laplacian and the mean curvature vector can be interpreted
as sums of eigenvalues of some matrices: the Hessian for the first quantity and
the Shape operator for the second one.

The MCF is well-known for its smoothing properties in the computer graphics
community (see \cite{desbrun1999implicit}) as well as in the image processing
one (see \cite{ciomaga2010level}). For example, Figure
\ref{fig:mean-curvature-flow-ex} is an illustration of the mean curvature flow
on a noisy surface (extracted from \cite{clarenz2000anisotropic}).

\begin{figure}[h]

        right)}
    \label{fig:mean-curvature-flow-ex}
\end{figure}

We will show in the last chapter of this report that this flow is related to the
variation of the area of the surface. If we try to transform the surface while
minimizing the area, we will obtain the same evolution as the one given by the
MCF. But let us keep in mind that we do not know the surface, only a finite set
of points that sample the surface. So, we will need a way to compute the area
without knowing the original surface. A common way of doing so is to consider
the volume of a union of balls centered on the points of the cloud.  We will
show that this quantity is proportional, under some conditions, to the area of
the underlying surface. Thus, it suffices to minimize the volume of this union
of balls to minimize the area of the underlying surface. We will call this
volume the energy $ A(P) $ associated to the point cloud $ P = \{ p_1, \ldots,
p_N \} $.

Now that we have our energy, we need to minimize it. If we are in three
dimensions then we can see the energy $ A $ as a function $ A : \R^{3N} \to \R
$. The main technique used for minimizing a function are based on the
computation of its gradient. So, we will need a way to compute the gradient of $
A $. There are many possibilities for doing this: one can use exact formulae if
they exist, or finite differences...

In this report, we will use another technique called \textit{Automatic
    Differentiation}. This technique is described in more details in Appendix
\appendixref{appendix:ad}. In short, it is a technique allowing us to compute
the derivatives of any quantity evaliated by a computer program. It exploits the
fact that any program can be thought of as a sequence of basic arithmetic
operations and elementary functions. Now, using the chain rule and overloading
the number type we can compute derivatives without changing too much the cost of
the original function.  This will allow us to only worry about the computation
of $ A(P) $ and not of its gradient. This will also allow us to consider
different kind of energies: the volume of the union of balls, the area of the
boundary of the union and also anisotropic ones. Let us detail the latter point.

Anisotropic smoothing is a type of smoothing where the magnitude will depend on
the point and the topology of its neighbourhood. In image processing, this
technique is called anisotropic diffusion (see \cite{weickert1998anisotropic}):
it reduces the image noise without removing significant parts of the image such
as sharp edges, lines...

During this internship, we were interested in a kind of anisotropic evolution
based on \cite{chambolle2012nonlocal} where the smoothing will be stronger in
some privileged directions. These directions will be given by the user.

Anisotropic flow may have applications that we did not have time to explore
during this internship. It could be used, for example, in physically based
simulations like crystal growth. Another example would be when we
process a 3D scan of an object: we want to be able to smooth the point cloud
while preserving certain details (such as the signature of the author on a
sculpture).

This report is structured as follows: first, we study the two dimensional case.
We show that our discrete MCF is able to smooth a point cloud and can be used to
estimate the mean curvature vector. Then, we consider the 3D case and study an
anisotropic flow. The final part will be dedicated to the theory: we will show
that one step of the constructed discrete MCF is an approximation of one Euler
step for the continuous MCF.
