Given a cloud of points, we want to be able to smooth it by taking into account
the different scales present in the cloud. We want to have a more important
smoothing on large parts of the point set.

A lot of smoothing algorithms already exist, some are related to Computer
Vision, some are more based on Computational Geometry:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Gaussian / Laplacian smoothing and all the derived filters
    \item Jet smoothing: a jet is a truncated Taylor expansion. Such jets are
        fitted on the surface. Jets are good because they intrinsically contain
        differential information such as normal, curvature...
\end{itemize}

In this report, we will focus on another algorithm which was proposed by
\cite{chambolle2012nonlocal}. Basically, it is a mean curvature flow under an
energy minimization. This energy is related to a non-local curvature.
