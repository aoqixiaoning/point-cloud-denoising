\chapter{Half-space intersection}
\label{appendix:code-intersection}

Here is a sketch of the code used in the 3D case for computing the intersection
of half-spaces:

\lstinputlisting[language=C++]{code/halfspace_intersection_with_dual_3.h}

The function \texttt{construct\_dual} constructs the dual polyhedron by
attaching to each vertex its corresponding primal plane. The function
\texttt{primal\_from\_dual} constructs the primal polyhedron from the dual one.
