\chapter{3D case}

In this part, we will be interested in doing the same job in 3D as in 2D except
that we will use a convex polyhedron instead of an euclidean ball in the
Minkowski sum.

This choice will raise a number of issues such as the construction of the
Voronoi diagram of a point set under a polyhedral norm.

\section{Polyhedral norm}
A polyhedral norm is a norm $ N $ defined as the following:

$$ \forall x \in \mathbb{R}^d,~ N(x) = \max_{i} (x | v_i) $$

where the $ v_i $ are given vectors from $ \mathbb{R}^d $.

This definition implies that the unit ball for the norm $ N $ is a polyhedron.
Indeed, if $ x \in B_N(0, 1) $, then :

$$ N(x) \leq 1 \Longleftrightarrow \forall i, (x | v_i) \leq 1 $$

So, the unit ball is defined by linear constraints. Thus, it is an intersection
of halfspaces and so is a convex polyhedron. Hence, computing the $ r $-offset
of a point cloud under a polyhedral norm $ N $ is the same as computing the
Minkowski sum of a point cloud and a convex polyhedron.

\section{Construction of the Voronoi diagram for a polyhedral norm}

The main problem of a polyhedral norm is that the underlying Voronoi diagram is
not a partition of the space anymore.

For example, if we consider the $ L_\infty $ norm in the plane and two aligned
points, we have the following Voronoi diagram:

\subsection{Symbolic perturbation}

Given a polyhedral norm $ N $, we define its symbolic perturbation $ N_\epsilon
$ by: $ N_\epsilon (x) = N + \epsilon || x || $ where $ || \cdot || $ is an
euclidean norm (typically an $ L_p $ norm where $ 1 \leq p \leq +\infty $).

Then, we will show that the Voronoi cell of a point $ x $ under the norm $
N_\epsilon $ converges (when $ \epsilon \rightarrow 0 $) towards the Voronoi
cell defined as the following:

$$ V_{N'}(x, X) = \{ y \in \mathbb{R}^d,~\forall x' \in X,~N(x - y) \leq N(x'
-y) \text{ or } (N(x - y) = N(x' - y) \text { and } || x -y || \leq || x' - y ||) \} $$

First, we define the convergence of a set $ A $ towards another set $ B $: we
say that $ A $ converges towards $ B $ if the Hausdorff distance of $ A $ and $
B $ converges towards $ 0 $.

We recall that the Hausdorff distance is defined as follows:

$$ d_H(A, B) = \min \{ r \geq 0,~X \subset Y^{\oplus r} \text{ and } Y \subset
X^{\oplus r} \} $$

Now, we prove that $ V_{N_\epsilon}(x, X) $ converges towards $ V_{N'}(x, X) $
under the Hausdorff distance.

We want to prove that $ d_H(V_{N_\epsilon}(x, X), V_{N'}(x, X)) \rightarrow 0 $
Let's take a $ \delta > 0 $, we want to find $ \epsilon_\delta $ such that if $
\epsilon \leq \epsilon_\delta $ then $ d_H(V_{N_\epsilon}(x, X), V_{N'}(x, X))
\leq \delta $. The last inequality is equivalent to say that:
\begin{align}
    V_{N'}(x, X)) \subset V_{N_\epsilon}(x, X)^{\oplus \delta} \\
    V_{N_\epsilon}(x, X) \subset V_{N'}(x, X)^{\oplus \delta}
    \label{eqn:haussdorf-voronoi1}
\end{align}

Let's take care of the first inclusion:
% TODO: proof

And now the second inclusion:
Let's take $ y \in V_{N_\epsilon}(x, X) $. By definition of $ N_\epsilon $, we
have: $ \forall x' \in X,~N(x - y) + \epsilon || x - y || \leq N(x' - y) +
\epsilon || x' - y || $. If we choose $ z = y $ then $ z $ satisfies $ || z - y
|| \leq \delta $ and $ z \in V_{N'}(x, X) $. Indeed, using the previous
inequality, there are two cases: either $ N(x - y) \leq N(x' - y) $ or $ N(x -
y) = N(x' - y) $. In the latter case, the inequality reduces to: $ || x - y || \leq
|| x' - y || $. So $ y \in V_{N'}(x, X)^{\oplus \delta} $.

We also want to prove that this new Voronoi diagram has good properties, notably
this new diagram forms a good "partition" of $ \mathbb{R}^d $. Thus, we need to
define what a "good" partition is.
We can define it in two ways:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item for any point $ x $, $ V_{N'}(x, X) $ is homeomorphic to a disk. For
        any couple $ (x, y) $, $ V_{N'}(x, X) \cap V_{N'}(y, X) $ is
        homeomorphic to a segment / half-line / line. For any triplet $ (x, y,
        z) $, $ V_{N'}(x, X) \cap V_{N'}(y, X) \cap V_{N'}(z, X) $ is
        homeomorphic to a point.
    \item Let's consider the open Voronoi regions: $ \ocirc{V}_N(x, X) = \{ y
        \in X,~ N(x - y) < N(x' - y)\} $. Then, we can define a good partition
        by saying that the complement of the open Voronoi regions must have a
        zero measure.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Construction of a Voronoi cell}

The construction of the Voronoi diagram under a polyhedral norm is a complex
topic and had been studied thoroughly in \cite{ma2000bisectors}.

For the duration of this internship, we had the choice between three paths
(by increasing order of difficulty):
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Construction of $ V(p, P) \cap B(p, r) $
    \item Construction of $ V(p, P) \cap B_N(p, r) $
    \item Construction of $ V_N(p, P) \cap B_N(p, r) $
\end{enumerate}

We chose the second path because the third one, as said previously, is a very
complex subject and can not be done during the internship because of its length.
Also, we can approximate the first one using the second one by choosing for $
B_N(p, r) $ a discretization of a sphere.

We used two different methods in order to evaluate the volume (or the area of
the boundary or more generally an additive measure $ \mu $) of $ V(p, P) \cap
B_N(p, r) $: a simple method by directly summing the quantities $ \mu(V(p, P)
\cap B_N(p, r)) $ or by using a variant of the inclusion-exclusion formula.

\subsubsection{Naive method}
% TODO

We want to compute :

$$ \mu(P + r B_N(0, 1)) = \sum_p \mu(\bigcup_p B_N(p, r) \cap V(p, P)) $$

The idea of this method is to approximate $ \mu(\bigcup_p B_N(p, r) \cap V(p,
P)) $ by $ \mu(B_N(p, r) \cap V(p, P)) $.

It is an approximation because, for example, if we want to compute the perimeter
of the boundary of squares in 2D, the difference between what we want to compute
and what we actually compute is:

\begin{figure}[H]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[scale=0.8]{3d/3d_perimeter_squares}
    \caption{In red what we compute}

    \includegraphics[scale=0.8]{3d/3d_perimeter_squares_truth}
    \caption{In green what we want}
\end{figure}

We see that there is a small difference between the two: our computation is just
an approximation.

\subsubsection{Inclusion-exclusion formula}
% TODO

The inclusion-exclusion formula is a well known formula which describes the
indicator function of a union of sets: given a finite number of sets $ A = \{
A_1, \ldots, A_N \} $, we have:

$$ \indicator{\bigcup A_i} = \sum_{\emptyset \neq X \subseteq A} (-1)^{card X -
    1} \indicator{\bigcap X} $$

This formula can also be expressed using the notion of nerve as shown in
\cite{attali2007inclusion}. We defined the nerve of $ A = \{ A_x, x \in X \} $
to be the graph where an edge exists between $ x $ and $ y $ only if $ A_x \cap
A_y \neq \emptyset $.

Then, we can write the inclusion-exclusion formula as:

$$ \indicator{\bigcup A_x} = \sum_{\sigma \in Nerve(A)} (-1)^{\dim \sigma}
\indicator{\bigcap \sigma} $$

In our case, we get:

\begin{equation}
    \indicator{\bigcup B_N(p, r)} = \sum_{\sigma \in Nerve(B)} (-1)^{\dim \sigma}
    \indicator{\bigcap \sigma}
    \label{eqn:incl_excl_simplices}
\end{equation}

where $ B $ is the collection of all the balls $ B_N(p, r), p \in P $.

We will need the following definition:
\begin{definition}
    The $\alpha$-complex of a set of points $ X $ denoted by $ Del(X, \alpha) $
    is a subset of the Delaunay triangulation.

    For each simplex of the Delaunay triangulation, we can associate to it a
    characteristic radius: the radius of the smallest empty circle containing
    the simplex.

    Now, the $\alpha$-complex contains all the simplices of the Delaunay
    triangulation whose characteristic radii is smaller than $\alpha$.
\end{definition}

Now, we will approximate \ref{eqn:incl_excl_simplices} by replacing $ Nerve(B)
$ by $ Del(P, r) $.

% TODO: explain why approximation

A question we can ask is: is the inclusion-exclusion formula still valid if we
replace $ Nerve(B) $ with $ Nerve(\{ B_N(p, r) \cap V(p, P), p \in P\}) $ ?

If we want to prove this assertion, we may use the technique used to prove the
inclusion-exclusion formula for union of balls.

The proof starts by defining the subcomplex $ L_p $ induced by a vertex $ p $.
We consider all the polyhedrons that contains $ p $ and we construct the nerve of
it. Formally, $ L_p = Nerve(\{ B_N(x, r), p \in B_n(x, r)\}) $.

Then, when we evaluate the indicator function at $ p $ of the union, we can
decompose it in two parts: simplices of $ L_p $ and the other ones.

\begin{align*}
    \indicator{\bigcup B_N(p, r)}(p) &= \sum_{\sigma \in L_p} (-1)^{\dim \sigma}
    \indicator{\bigcap \sigma}(p) + \sum_{\sigma \notin L_p} (-1)^{\dim \sigma}
    \underbrace{\indicator{\bigcap \sigma}(p)}_{= 0 \text{ since } p \notin
        \sigma} \\
    &= \sum_{\sigma \in L_p} (-1)^{\dim \sigma} \\
    &= \chi(L_p)
\end{align*}

Here, $ \chi $ is the Euler characteristic of $ L_p $.

Now, if we show that $ L_p $ is contractible (can be continuously deformed to a
point), we will get $ \chi(L_p) = 1 $. Obviously, we also have $
\indicator{\bigcup B_N(p, r)}(p) = 1 $ and we conclude that the formula
\ref{eqn:incl_excl_simplices} is true.

We can use this argument to generalize this formula. If we suppose the there
exists $ r, r' $ such that: $ B(p, r) \subseteq B_N(p, r) \subseteq B(p, r') $,
then we have: $ K_p \subseteq L_p \subseteq K'_p $ where $ K_p $ (resp. $ K'_p $)
is the induced subcomplex of $ p $ in the simplicial complex defined by all the
balls $ B(p, r) $ (resp. $ B(p, r') $), $ p \in P $.

Then, we know that $ K_p $ and $ K'_p $ are either empty or contractible. We
want to deduce that $ L_p $ is either empty or contractible.
