Nowadays, the traditional methods used for smoothing a point cloud are the
following:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Moving Least Squares (MLS) and its adaptive variant
    \item Laplacian smoothing
\end{itemize}

In this internship, we chose to use a Mean Curvature Flow based technique.

Let's recall the more important results related to the MCF.
First the definition of this flow, given a surface. We want to move each point f
this surface in the direction of its inward normal by an amount related to the
mean curvature at this point.

Multiple approaches exist:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Level-set approach: the moving surface is represented by : $ \{ x |
        \phi(x, t) = 0 \} $. Then $ \phi $ satisfies the following equation: $
        \frac{\partial \phi}{\partial t} = |\nabla \phi| div(\frac{\nabla
            \phi}{| \nabla \phi |}) $.
    \item Graph approach: the surface is a graph of a function $ f : U
        \rightarrow \R $. Then $ f $ satisfies the following equation: $
        \frac{\partial f}{\partial t} = \sqrt{|\nabla f|^2 + 1} ~div(\frac{\nabla
        f}{\sqrt{|\nabla f|^2 + 1}}) $.
\end{itemize}

The MCF is well known for its smoothing properties used for example in image
processing (see \cite{ciomaga2010level}).

We can also relate the MCF to the gradient flow of the surface area functional.
